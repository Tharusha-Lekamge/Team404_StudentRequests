# Student Request Management System
## Problem Statement

Using this system, students can send requests to academic staff on matters such as late add/drop requests, extend assignment submission deadlines, repeat exams as first attempt with the next batch etc. The requestee lecturers can accept, decline or request for additional details on the requests. They can also make comments on the requests made by the students.

## Architecture
The SRMS is developed based on client-server architecture. The following models were used to 
Used Models -
#### 1. User model - 
   This model describes all the properties of a given user in the system. The user has properties such as, username (which is the unique identifier), password, index number (for students) and the user type (student/staff/admin). 
#### 2. Request model - 
A request is considered an object with properites such as request type, sender's details (index number, username), request information, 
submitted date and the approval status. A request is in 'pending' status by default once it is sent. After the requestee has viewed it and decided to approve or decline it, then the approval status of the request will change accordingly. 
The database design consists of the above 2 models.
Behaviour driven development was used for development and testing of the system.
